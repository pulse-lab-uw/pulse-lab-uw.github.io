										<h2>PULSE Lab</h2>
										<p>Supporting access to useful scientific knowledge</p>
									</header>
									<p>At the PULSE lab, we seek to bridge the gaps between researchers and other publics. To do this,
                                        we 1) study technology like social media and the people who use it, 2) design tools to support
                                        researchers doing public outreach, 3) and explore how different publics make sense of research knowledge. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Our projects fall under many umbrellas, but they all follow the same broad goal: promoting scientific 
                                        knowledge in a way that is understandable, useful, and credible to diverse, overlapping publics.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>At the PULSE lab, we seek to embody the following principles:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Open access.</b> We're a science communication lab, so we publish blog posts of all our projects, and provide access to papers 
                                            (where legally possible).</li>
                                        <li><b>Evolution.</b> None of us are perfect, but our goal is to constantly improve. We seek to foster a culture of 
                                            feedback, internal peer review, and support in order to make us all better researchers. </li>
                                        <li><b>Integrity.</b> We want to do good research! This means seeking impactful questions, following honest research practices,
                                            and developing sound methodology.</li>
                                        <li><b>Support.</b> This lab is meant to be a place for students to learn how to do research. This 
                                        can only happen in an environment of inclusivity, empathy, support, and kindness to each other.</li>

									<h3>How to get involved</h3>
									<p>There are several ways for University of Washington students to get involved; as a co-pilot, volunteer, research capstone student, 
                                        or PhD student. If interested, please email Spencer Williams at sw1918@uw.edu. Make sure to include the following information:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Your resume/CV</li>
                                        <li>A list of related classes you've taken (for co-pilot, volunteer, capstone)</li>
                                        <li>An overview of your previous research experience (for volunteer, capstone, PhD)</li>
                                        <li><b>Why you want to work at this lab, and what projects you're interested in.</b> There are lots of great labs at UW, so 
                                        why this one?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Co-pilot</h4>
                                    <p>Are you interested in trying out research, but don't have any background? Co-pilots are members of
                                        the lab that can help out whenever they want, without a minimum number of hours per week. They are generally
                                        assigned to a specific project, but are free to move between projects if they want. Co-pilots...
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Have no minimum hourly requirement.</li>
                                        <li>Can help out whenever they want.</li>
                                        <li>Require no experience with research.</li>
                                        <li>Are perfect for those who want to try out research in a low-stakes way.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Volunteer</h4>
                                    <p>Volunteers are lab members with a longer-term stake in the lab. They have more privileges than 
                                        co-pilots, but have more responsibilities as well. Volunteers include former co-pilots, 
                                        independent studies students, and students with previous experience working in other lab settings.
                                        Volunteers are expected to devote more hours to the lab, in order to gain the experiences and skills that 
                                        would be expected from a seasoned lab member. 
                                        Volunteers...</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Have a minimum 8 hour per week requirement.</li>
                                        <li>Have priority in being trained over co-pilots.</li>
                                        <li>Are eligible to lead projects, and get authorship on publications.</li>
                                        <li>Are involved in interviewing and hiring new lab members.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Research capstone</h4>
                                    <p>Informatics students in the UW iSchool have the option of completing research capstones, which involve
                                        taking on a (usually) 2-quarter commitment to lead a research project (this can be an offshoot of an
                                        existing project, or something totally new!). This is another great way to get involved with the lab
                                        for graduating informatics students. Research capstone students...
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Have the same general duties and responsibilities as volunteers.</li>
                                        <li>Are eligible to shift to volunteer status if they want to continue with their projects, seek
                                            publication, etc.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>PhD student</h4>
                                    <p>PhD students generally have the highest priority for training, resources, funding, etc. I can't 
                                        admit PhD students directly, but you can take a look at the iSchool's
                                        <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/phd/admissions">doctorate in information science</a>
                                        for information on how to apply. I am also open to co-advising PhD students with faculty from other departments at UW.
                                        PhD students...
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Lead large-scale, long-term projects.</li>
                                        <li>Are a good option for people who want high-level training in research, to become a professor, research scientist, etc.</li>
                                        <li>Generally take 5-6 years to complete.</li>
                                    </ul>
